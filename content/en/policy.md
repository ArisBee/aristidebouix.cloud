## __Definitions__

There are several definitions in the GDPR. The most important definitions are:

* ‘personal data’ means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person
* ‘processing’ means any operation […] on personal data […] such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction

If I talk about your personal data in the following, I mean anything that can be used to identify you. This includes your name, e-mail address, and IP address. When I talk about “processing of personal data”, I mean any type of processing.

## __Personal data I process__

When you visit my website, your **IP address** and user agent are automatically processed by Amazon Cloudfront. I automatically get this data from your client (e.g., your web browser or RSS/Atom feed reader). Cloudfront needs your IP address to send my contents back to your client. Cloudfront is only a caching service and AWS isn't supposed to retain a copy of the access logs as they are a [GDPR compliant data processor](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/all-aws-services-gdpr-ready/).


The legal basis for processing your personal data as explained above is Article 6(1) f GDPR. 

## __Logging__

Cloudfront writes information about certain client-side request to so-called log files. I use these log files to detect attack-like behavior and to improve our services. Thos log files are automatically encrypted using S3 server-side-encryption and deleted after 30 days.
