I'm excited to share a video about my experience working with Orca Security as Catawiki's Product Security Architect! 

When it comes to protecting an organization's assets, having the right tools and solutions in place is critical. Orca Security has been a valuable partner in helping us enhance our security posture. With their cloud-based platform, we've gained a much better visibility and control of our assets, allowing to identify and remediate critical security issues. This has helped us stay ahead of potential threats and secure our environment.

In the video, I share how Orca Security has contributed to our success at Catawiki, and how it's helped us protect our critical assets. I believe that by sharing our experiences with others, we can help make the cybersecurity community stronger and more secure.

As a seasoned cybersecurity and cloud professional, I'm always looking for ways to improve our security posture and stay ahead of the curve. If you're looking to rapidly enhance your organization's security, I highly recommend checking out Orca Security and seeing how they can help you achieve your goals.

Thank you for taking the time to watch the video, and feel free to reach out if you have any questions or comments!
