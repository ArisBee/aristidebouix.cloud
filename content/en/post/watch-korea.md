Hello, dear readers!

It's been a while since I last posted. How have you been?

Today, I want to share something a bit differentâ€”more about my personal experiences and travels, and how they tie into my professional values.

Recently, I visited Daegu in Korea while working there a few months ago, and I'd like to tell you about my day there.

My visit to Daegu was quite spontaneous. I was on a spa trip with my wife and parents-in-law near the city. On our way back, we realized Daegu was close by and decided to make a stop. The main reason for visiting was to see a small watch repair atelier.

I have a special timepiece from my dad, a family heirloom passed down from his father. In our family, there's a tradition of gifting a fine timepiece (specifically a pocket watch) when one comes of age. My dad, being the youngest and somewhat of a rebel in our business-oriented family, chose a practical wrist watch instead of the traditional pocket watch. This choice symbolized his desire to live life on his own terms.

This watch, now mine, represents his adventurous spirit and faith in his own path. However, being a manual watch, it needed some maintenance. I discovered that a renowned watch repair artisan, recognized worldwide, operates in Daegu.

This artisan is known for his expertise in repairing prestigious watches, often receiving referrals from brands like Patek Philippe and Rolex when they encounter particularly challenging repairs. He mentioned this to me, though I can't verify it without written proof! Nonetheless, his numerous awards and official recognition by the Korean government speak volumes about his professionalism.

Despite all the awards and recognition, I was very impressed by how he kept his business small. His atelier is located in a watch street filled with luxurious and fancy stores, yet he runs it with his wife without any advertisements. As he says, people who need to know him already do, so they come to him with challenging fixes for watches and clocks.

I wanted my watch serviced and showed it to him. After examining it for a while, the first thing he said was, "This watch is very precious." He explained that it's a well-made watch and not easily found nowadays. He seemed particularly fond of vintage watches from the 1940s, appreciating their intricate mechanisms as works of art.

I left my watch for a full check-up and fixes, and on the way back home, I felt inspired. I was quite impressed by his humility and down-to-earth attitude despite his skills and lifelong experience.
These days, many people brag about small achievements, but this man, with his exceptional talent, remained humble. His ability to keep working passionately at his age, which seemed to be around 70, was truly inspiring.

This experience brought me some ideas about what I might be doing at his age. For passionate individuals like him or my dad, retirement seems to have no limits. This trip was quite unexpected, but I love these moments of spontaneous discovery. They remind me that continuous learning and dedication to our craft can keep us engaged and motivated, regardless of age.

Carrying this inspiration with my watch every day, I am reminded of the values of humility, passion, and lifelong learning. Whether in our professional or personal lives, these values can lead to a fulfilling and impactful journey.
