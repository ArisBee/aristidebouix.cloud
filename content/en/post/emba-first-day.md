Hello, dear readers!

Today, I'm thrilled to share with you an exhilarating journey I embarked upon - my first day at the Executive MBA program at HEC Jouy-en-Josas. This day wasn't just about academic rigor; it was a fusion of history, strategy, and a remarkable dinner at a place steeped in royal heritage!

# The Morning Buzz: Meeting the Cohort

Our day began bright and early at 8:30 AM, setting the standard for all in-class days to come. Most of the program is conducted online, so when it's time for an in-person session, you know you're in for some short nights :sleepy:. It was exhilarating to finally meet my fellow participants face-to-face. The group was a vibrant tapestry of professionals, ranging from sales and banking to engineering and HR experts, enriched by a healthy mix of French and international voices.

The welcoming talk at 9 AM offered more than just an introduction; it provided a deep dive into HEC's illustrious history. Learning about its origins dating back to Napoleon III and its evolution into a modern campus under Charles de Gaulle was truly fascinating.

# Embracing a Unique Identity

What struck me the most was the ethos of the EMBA program. We were not mere students; we were participants with rich histories and experiences. The emphasis was on personal growth and leveraging our unique identities, rather than just acquiring a diploma. The humorous nudge about the program's cost being higher because we are participants, not students, was a light-hearted reminder of the journey's value.

# The Art of Decision Making: Business Simulation Game

In the afternoon, we plunged into a business simulation overseen by Professor [Olivier Tabatoni](http://www.oliviertabatoni.com/). It was a practical test of strategy, involving decisions to grow a classic manufacturing company over four business quarters. I took the lead in preparing for the first quarter, focusing on a balanced approach to product rollout.

Despite a rocky start due to a team member's ambitious pricing strategy, we quickly adapted. My strategy of minimizing inventory and careful observation paid off, allowing us to dominate the market, especially with our new product. This experience not only tested our analytical skills but also highlighted the importance of flexibility and rapid adaptation in business.

Winning the simulation earned us accolades and a reputation within the cohort. It was a testament to the power of quiet analysis, strategic thinking, and the ability to guide a team with informed decisions.

# An Evening of Elegance and Networking

The day culminated with a toast and dinner at the historical HEC Castle - a former haunt of Louis XIV. The setting was as regal as it was conducive to networking and sharing experiences with my peers.
Professor Olivier's revelation that the simulation's purpose extended beyond market dominance, encompassing investments in sales teams and R&D, was an eye-opener. It underscored the multifaceted nature of business strategy which will be the subject of our second in-class module in April.
